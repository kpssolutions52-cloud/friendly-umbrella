## Troubleshooting

### Registration Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid registration type" error
- **Solution**: Ensure you've selected a registration type from the dropdown before submitting

**Problem**: Cannot select company/supplier
- **Solution**: Verify that active companies/suppliers exist in the system. New registrations must be approved first.

**Problem**: Registration successful but cannot log in
- **Solution**: Your account is pending approval. Contact your organization admin or super admin.

### Approval Issues

**Problem**: Cannot see pending users
- **Solution**: Ensure you're logged in as an admin user with the correct permissions

**Problem**: Cannot approve users
- **Solution**: Verify you have admin privileges. Only admins can approve/reject users.

**Problem**: User still cannot log in after approval
- **Solution**: Check user status in User Management. Ensure status is set to "Active".
