## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

The construction industry is stuck in the past, relying on outdated, manual processes for pricing and procurement that waste time, reduce efficiency, and create unnecessary friction between suppliers and companies.

### The Current Pain Points

#### For Construction Companies & Estimators
- **📞 Endless Phone Calls** - Spending hours calling multiple suppliers to get quotes and check prices
- **📧 Scattered Information** - Price data buried in emails, phone notes, and supplier websites
- **⏰ Delayed Responses** - Waiting days for suppliers to respond with updated pricing
- **🔍 No Comparison Tools** - Difficulty comparing prices across suppliers efficiently
- **💼 Manual Quote Management** - RFQs scattered across email threads and phone conversations
- **📊 Limited Transparency** - No visibility into negotiated/private pricing for team members

#### For Suppliers
- **📱 Multiple Communication Channels** - Managing pricing inquiries through phone, email, WhatsApp, and more
- **🔄 Time-Consuming Updates** - Manually updating prices for each company individually
- **📉 Missed Opportunities** - Limited visibility to reach potential buyers
- **💸 Pricing Complexity** - Difficult to manage default vs. private pricing relationships
- **📋 Manual Catalog Management** - No centralized system to showcase products and services

### The Real Cost

- **Lost Productivity**: Estimators spend 2-3 hours daily on price discovery
- **Delayed Projects**: Slow price updates delay project timelines and budgets
- **Missed Opportunities**: Suppliers miss potential sales due to poor visibility
- **Communication Overhead**: Constant phone calls interrupt workflow for both parties
- **Data Fragmentation**: No centralized pricing history or analytics
